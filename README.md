# Squire

Squire is a tool for writing (and soon reading) interactive fiction written in Markdown.

## Installation

Note: Squire requires a working [Go](https://golang.org/) installation. I'll try to get releases set up soon but you can use the online version in the meantime at https://www.squirebooks.com

```bash
go install github.com/semanticart/squire@latest
```

Then (assuming your GOPATH is correct) you can run the command with `squire`
